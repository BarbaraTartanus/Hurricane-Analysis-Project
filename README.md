**Project Title**

Hurricane Analysis

**Project Goals** 

Using fundamental knowledge of Python to organize and process the data of 34 different Category 5 hurricanes in order to find solutions for nine different tasks. 

**Result**

My solutions are under ==Atlantic_Hurricanes_Project.py==.  As a comparison I have added the solutions provided by the learning platform under ==Hurricanes_Project_Solution.py==.  

 
**Task 1**

Write a function that returns a new list of updated damages where the recorded data is converted to float values and the missing data is retained as "Damages not recorded". 

**Task 2** 

Construct a dictionary made out of the lists, where the keys of the dictionary are the names of the hurricanes, and the values are dictionaries themselves containing a key for each piece of data. 

**Task 3** 

Write a function that converts the current dictionary of hurricanes to a new dictionary, where the keys are years and the values are lists containing a dictionary for each hurricane that occurred in that year. 

**Task 4** 

Write a function that counts how often each area is listed as an affected area of a hurricane. Store and return the results in a dictionary where the keys are the affected areas and the values are counts of how many times the areas were affected. 

**Task 5** 

Write a function that finds the area affected by the most hurricanes, and how often it was hit. 

**Task 6** 

Write a function that finds the hurricane that caused the greatest number of deaths, and how many deaths it caused. 

**Task 7** 

Write a function that rates hurricanes on a mortality scale according to the provided ratings, where the key is the rating and the value is the upper bound of deaths for that rating. 

**Task 8** 

Write a function that finds the hurricane that caused the greatest damage, and how costly it was. 

**Task 9** 

Write a function that rates hurricanes on a damage scale according to the provided ratings, where the key is the rating and the value is the upper bound of damage for that rating.
